What matters is determining if your habits are leading you to the path of success. If you are a millionaire but spend more than you earn each month, then you are on a bad path. If your consumption habits do not change, you will not end well. On the other hand, if you're broke but manage to save a little each month, then you're on a path to financial freedom, even if it takes longer than you'd like to do so.
Your results are the reactive indicators of your habits. The amount of money you have is a reactive indicator of your financial habits. Your current weight is an indicator of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a reactive indicator of your study habits. The appearance of your house is a reactive indicator of your habits of order and cleanliness. In the end you get what you repeat";
